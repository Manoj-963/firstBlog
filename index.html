      <p>Inside these tags some other content can be included which are called as <strong>attributes.</strong> <br>Attributes will help us in making the content look the way we want it to be .</p>
      <p>Though HTML is for <em>structure</em><br>CSS is for <em>styling</em> <br>Javascript is for <em>behaviour</em> of the website, </p>
      <p>HTML can be used for basic styling too but using CSS is a better choice.</p>
      <p>THANK YOU!</p>
